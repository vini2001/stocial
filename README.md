A flutter project to automatically retrieve all my US and Brazilian Stocks.

In the future I expect it to have rebalancing features and maybe even more.

This is a personal project, not started with commercial goals.
I can't dedicate much time into this project, so possibly it will have incomplete features and messy code (to be refactored in the future)
